      <h5>Flexible Reporting Platform</h5>  

      <p>SQL Server Reporting Services is the reporting platform for SQLClue. While the provided reports are rich and complete, using native 
      Reporting Services as the reporting platform allows users to further customize the report format and library content. Reporting Services 
      options also enables SQLClue reporting to be easily integrated with a Share Point server or other already established intranet reporting 
      platform. After all, making information available to those that need it is one of the principles of effective database monitoring. Furthermore, 
      users are free to develop custom reporting as determined appropriate by the organization.</p>

      <p>A rich library of reports is integrated into the SQLClue Console using the Visual Studio 2008 ReportViewer control. Many of these 
      reports are useful for SQLClue administrators for planning as well as to review and identify configuration changes. 
      Other reports are more interesting to technical managers in determining the level of any individual's participation in the shared SQLClue 
      Data Center Runbook effort. The report definitions for Report Server deployment of the reports interesting to the broader audience of 
      technicians and developers are included in the SQLClue resources along with the matching .rdlc definitions used by the ReportBiewer control.
      In fact, much care has been given to make the same reports usable within the ReportView Control or deployed to a Report Server.</p>

     <p>The Data Center Runbook provides tracking and activity reports. The reports can be used by everyone or limited to a group such as 
      managers and team leads at user decision as determined by the organization. These reports provide measures of individual contributions 
      as well as high level trend analysis of changes. This provides a mechanism for an objective work performance evaluation of technical
      experts by supervisors that often do not share the same depth of specialized knowledge as the technical experts.</p> 
      
      <p>For example, the Data Center Runbook peer ratings given and received can be helpful to identify individuals that stand out - whether 
      above or below - in the eyes of others among the technical team. Those that manage and evaluate the group of SQLClue users get a rare 
      tool that provides objective and quantifiable information about each member of the group alongside anecdotal and concrete feedback from 
      other team members.</p>

      <p>The <a href="Runbook.htm"><b>Data Center Runbook</b></a> is a searchable, peer-reviewed SQL Server knowledge and information library.
      This is a widely shared expressly easy to use organizational data store for the assembly and organization of the knowledge and documentation necessary 
      for the routine administration and operations of the organization's SQL Servers. </p>
