<!--BEGIN ADD HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION-->

<p>The SQLClue Automation Controller Service is a Windows Service. The service is configured andd installed from the SQLClue 
   Administrator's Console.  Use the Automation Controller to carry out all SQLClue data collection and synchronization activities 
   at regular intervals. It is important to use only the SQLClue Administrator's Console to install and interact with the Automation 
   Controller service to assure that all configuration changes are properly communicated to the service.</p>

<p>The SQL Configuration Repository component uses the Automation Controller to collect data from each 
   target server associated via a scheduled collector.</p> 
<p>The Data Center Runbook component uses the Automation Controller Service to maintain 
   synchronization between file system documents and the full text indexed copy of the document stored in the database.</p>

<!--BEGIN ADD PRINCIPALS fundamental truths-->

<p>The SQLClue Automation Controller Windows Service handles routine SQLClue operations. This frees highly skilled
   data professionals to conduct more urgent and varied activities yet assures that the routine activities are not skipped in
   the interest of more pressing issues. As we all know, without the routine activities, the more pressing issues are frequently 
   compounded in the long run. Routine SQLClue operations include Configuration Archives and processing and monitoring of Data 
   Center Runbook document changes.</p>
<p>A Windows Service is used for scheduling so that SQLClue can be hosted on any Edition SQL Server 2008 including the
   freely distributed Express Edition with Advanced Services Editions - even though SQLExpress has no SQLAgent capabilities. Express Edition 
   installations must include the Advanced Services optioins for adequate support of SQLClue Full Text Search functions.</p>
<p>A Windows Service is used rather than a Web Service because the context and sensitivity of the SQLClue content should never be allowed 
   to propagate outside the security citadel of the data center or environment. A Windows Service can be very effectively secured and is 
   less prone to access and malicious use from outside the boundaries of the trusted domain perimeter.</p>

<!--BEGIN ADD CONSIDERATIONS areas the user must think carefully about-->
 
<h4>Security Considerations</h4> 
<h5>The SQLClue Automation Controller Service Start-up Account</h5>
<p>Follow the same guidelines as recommended for the SQL Server service account in the 2008 Books Online topic: "Setting 
   up Windows Service Accounts". If SQL Server 2008 Books Online is not available refer to an online version of the documentation 
   on Microsoft's MSDN or TechNet web sites.</p>
<p>Due to the file access requirements and the administrative SQL Server access on all targets using the [Local System], 
   [Local Service] or [Network Service] service account options are not supported for the SQL Clue Automation Controller Service.</p>
<p>An otherwise un-privileged domain user account other than the account used for the host SQL Server is strongly recommended. 
   Do not use the same account for the SQLClue Service and the SQLClue host SQL Server. The SQLClue Automation Controller 
   requires administrative access to all targeted SQL Servers and requires the specific file system privileges listed below for 
   any location hosting Runbook Documents.</p>
<p>All SQLClue automation file system I/O and database access is intended to done using the rights and permissions of the SQLClue Automation 
   Controller service account. Because network security topologies are highly variable and often proprietary, file system security 
   is not attempted by SQLClue but must be configured and managed by other means. The SQLClue console provides prompts when 
   security requirements are created or changed. It is up to the user to assure that all such prompts are properly addressed.</p>
<p>SQL Configuration Archive scheduled processing requires that the Automation Controller is a member of the <i>sysadmin</i> Fixed 
   Server Role on all targeted SQL Servers. While most of the DDL itmes can be scripted with only VIEW DEFINITION permission, a 
   number of the metadata items archived can only be accessed by users with the highest level of access.</p>   
<p>For the Data Center Runbook the SQLClue Automation Controller service account must have read access to all folders that will be 
   monitored by the Data Center Runbook File Watcher. The File Watcher automatically keeps the Full Text search indexing in sync 
   with changes to the underlying documents. When new document references are added to the data store, the user adding the 
   document is clearly advised of the access that will be required by the service account.</p>
 <p>Lastly, the SQLClue console must be set to "run as administrator". This is necessary so the console can install and control 
 the Automation Controller Service.</p> 
 
 <p>To set SQLClue to "run as administrator" on Windows Vista use these steps as outlined in 
 Microsoft's KB article 922708:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>Right-click the icon that you use to run the program, and then click Properties. On the Shortcut tab, the Target box contains 
 the location and the name of the program file.</li>
 <li>Open the folder that contains the program file.</li>
 <li>Right-click the program file, and then click Properties.</li>
 <li>On the Compatibility tab, click to select the Run this program as an administrator check box, and then click OK.</li>
 </ol>

<!--BEGIN ADD GUIDELINES (best) practices and procedures-->

The SQLClue Automation Control is designed to be managed using the SQLClue console. While the service can be Started, Paused, 
Continued and Stopped using the Windows Service Manager snap-in, the synchronization of settings between the application and the 
service can only be maintained when the SQLClue console is used. When a changed is accepted by the SQLClue console that
requires propagation to the Automation Controller, it happens effortlessly with no user action required.
