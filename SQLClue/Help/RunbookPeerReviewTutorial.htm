<h4>Peer Review in the SQLClue Runbook</h4>

    <p>This page demonstrates how to provide peer review feedback for a SQLClue Runbook Topic and how to view the existing peer review
       activity for a SQLClue Runbook Topic.</p>

    <p>Categories, Topics and Documents are all peer review capable in the SQL Runbook. The rating dialog is the same for all. 
    Categories are rated using the Category Editor Dialog data grid found in the Tools menu, Topics are rated using the Topic List 
    data grid (upper panel) of the SQLClue Runbook Tab and Documents are rated using the Documents data grid in the Topic Editor (lower panel)
    of the SQLClue Runbook Tab.</p>

    <p>The peer review rating cell is always in the first column of the data grid.</p>

    <p>To begin this walkthrough a Topic must exist in the SQLClue Runbook. If there are currently no Topics, the reader can
       first complete the <a href="RunbookContributorTutorial.htm">Contributing to the SQLClue Runbook</a> How-to help document. The
       Topic created in that tutorial will be the referenced in what follows.</p>

    <h4><b>Rating a Runbook Topic</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Review the Topic for completeness, accuracy, suitability and relevance. Look for any benefits and risks.
        <p>The review will be presented from the technical perspective of the reviewer's area(s) of expertise and responsibility 
           within the organization, though any observations of the Topic's usefulness or risks, even if beyond the reviewer's 
           purvey are equally important. The purpose of the review is to appropriately reinforce the utility of Topic. When other's 
           access or search the SQLClue Runbook for knowledge and information, the existing reviews serve to establish the level of 
           acceptance of each Topic's content across the organization. For example, a Topic owned by the production DBA regarding 
           database backups will be seen from much different perspectives by a Data Center Operator and a Quality Assurance (QA) 
           Engineer. The Data center Operator may have unique knowledge of the storage limits for backup files while the QA Engineer 
           may have special needs to know the release level of the backup. The purpose of the the review is to bring both perspectives 
           in focus each time the Topic is viewed. This will greatly reduce the chances that important considerations are not overlooked 
           at any time.</p></li>
        <li>Load the Topic into the Topic List panel.</li>
        <li>Select the "Ratings" cell column of the Topic.</li>
        <li>The Peer Review Rating Dialog will open in the center of the SQLClue User Interface (UI) window.
        <p style="text-align:center"><img src="../Images/PeerReviewRating1.jpg" /></p></li>
        <li>Select the Radio Button in the right side panel adjacent to the rating number to be assigned.
        <p>Use the panels decision tree to assist in selecting the correct rating.</p></li>
        <li><b>Selecting the right Rating</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Consider the the three descriptors to the left in the panel to narrow the rating possibilities. These will 
                help to narrow your general inclination toward the reviewed item.</li>
                <ol>
                <li><b>Accurate</b> - the Topic is of high quality and value.
                <p>Narrows the Rating selection possibilities to 1, 2 or 3.</p></li>
                <li><b>Acceptable</b> - the Topic is good enough to be generally of value.
                <p>Narrows the Rating selection possibilities to 3 or 4.</p></li>
                <li><b>Avoid</b> - the Topic is of no help or value.
                <p>Narrows the Rating selection possibilities to 4, 5 or 6.</p></li>
                </ol>
            <li>Critically think about the Topic's suitability to each of the possible Ratings. SQLClue offers to facillitate 
                full and open communication in the interest of improving the shared working experience.
            <p>Additional considerations for each Rating are found by hovering the mouse over the rating text.</p></li>
            <li>Click in or tab to the chosen radio button to select.</li>
            </ol></li>
        <li>Insert a brief note explaining the rating in the "Rating Note" input box.</li>
        <li>Select [OK] to commit the rating to the data store.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4><b>Reviewing Existing Runbook Topic Ratings</b></h4>
    <p>The current rating for each Topic is shown on the Topic List data grid. This is the average for all ratings the Topic has
       received. The Rating cell for is also color coded in a stop light like color bar similar to the color bar of the Peer 
       Review Rating dialog: green indicating better rated ratings, turning to yellow and finally red for the lowest rating.</p>
    <p>Hovering on the rating shows the current user's most recent rating and the number of number of individuals that have rated the Topic.</p>
    <p>The rating dialog also shows the current average rating and the number of unique ratings at the bottom of the right side panel.
       To review all of your rating notes, select the upper - non-editable - notes panel of the dialog. This will launch the full 
       sized notes dialog.</p>
     <p>To review the ratings and notes of other users, navigate to the Topic in the SQLClue Runbook report hierarchy of the Reporting 
        Tab and drill into the ratings to get the Peer Review Rating Summary for a Topic. A similar summary is available for each Category 
        and Document. Of course custom views and reports accessible across the Environment and beyond can also be created on any Report Server
        that can access the SQLClue Runbook's database.</p>
