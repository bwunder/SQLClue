<h5>Data Center Runbook</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Library of Data Center knowledge and information
</li>
<li>Promotes team excellence
</li>
    <ul>
    <li>
    effortlessly bring documents into a shared library with no changes to how the document is already used    
    </li>
    <li>
    employ structured knowledge sharing practices to in reduced interruptions and raise data center performance levels
    </li>
    <li>
    introduce peer review feedback to improves quality of content in new and existing documents  
    </li>
    </ul>
<li>
Enables business continuity best practices and business alignment at the data layer
</li>
<li>
Intended as an open and shared resource for all involved in database administration and operations
</li>
<li>
Target database platform is Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition 2005 with Advanced Services.
Any edition of SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2008 can be used as the data store for convenience or scalability.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Three ways that the Data Center Runbook helps to assure business continuity:
    <ol>
    <li><b>Data Collection Method</b><br />
    The SQLClue Runbook provides a convenient and easy interface for those designated as contributors - usually all 
    administrators and operators at the location - to build and maintain a record of the knowledge and experience 
    necessary, lessons learn, and data collected during efforts to keep the organizations SQL Servers up and running.
    </li>
    <li><b>Highly Searchable Data Store</b><br />
    The SQLClue Runbook provides a full text search enabled common central reference for all involved in database operations 
    and administrations to quickly recover the knowledge and information necessary to maintain the required database 
    availability and support performance service levels. 
    </li>            
    <li><b>System Experts Surrogate</b><br />
    The SQLClue Runbook provides a documentation of existing knowledge that can be used even when the authors - presumably 
    the most knowledgeable on the topic among the internal group - are unavailable.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
All information relevant to the daily administration and operations of the SQL Servers in an environment must be 
included. By reviewing the entries, any individual with a working knowledge of SQL Server is able to quickly learn 
about all <i>in situ</i> processes, procedures, practices and protocols as well as the existence and current status 
of any outstanding issues.
</p>
<p>
The SQLClue Runbook recognizes the enormity of this task and provides planned operational activities and knowledge sharing 
within an innovative yet structured method incorporating:
</p>
<ul>
<li>light weight knowledge contribution requirements, for minimal staff time costs to manage data collection or the data store</li>
<li>peer review to increase accuracy of information, improve exposure across functional work areas and facilitate consensus decision-making</li>
<li>monitoring to determine how enthusiastically individuals are contributing to the strategic efforts</li>
</ul>

<p>Adhering to a Runbook oriented database administration and operations practice will reduce the number of interruptions 
   incurred by all. This often dramatic reduction in the number of interruptions combined with the ever increasing internal
   availability and accuracy of the knowledge and information help the organization transition from too much chaos and 
   firefighting mode to more structure and normalcy. To establish a peer reviewed documentation that holds the same answers 
   as the expert's sleeping brain, but is much more accessible than the expert at 3AM or on Saturday night.</p>

<!--BEGIN ADD PRINCIPALS fundamental truths-->
<p>The Runbook documents the administration and operation of the SQL Servers in an environment. 
This documentation should be as complete as is practical and cover all aspects from high level aspects like architectural  
decisions and development best practices and the delete/archive strategy to the daily minutiae like how to determine the 
currently available backups to tape, or the location of a database master key export. All information relevant to the daily 
administration and operations of the SQL Servers in an environment must be included. By reviewing the entries, a qualified 
individual is able to learn the reasons for any configuration changes from the defaults.</p>

<p>The SQLClue approach to Runbook building is to capture information about events and activities as they happen. A successful
SQLClue Runbook replaces the typical non-strategic approach of documenting anecdotally as time allows. The emphasis for the SQL 
Runbook is on the mandatory allocation of as little as 5 minutes by all designated personnel each day to add, review, and revise 
the knowledge and information pertaining to the administrative and operational activities for that day. Dedication to this 
approach assures relevance that will be unavoidably missed with anecdotal approaches.</p> 
<p>The SQLClue Runbook also provides an empirical measure of every individual's participation in the documentation process. This is 
useful for those that must manage and evaluate each individual in the designated pool.</p>

<img src="..\Images\SQLRunbook.jpg" />

<p>The SQLClue Runbook is composed of Documents organized by Topic. Each Document and each Topic are also designated as belonging 
   to one or more Categories. Limited only by the quality of the decisions during input, this Categories-Topics-Documents matrix 
    yields a highly searchable resource. Search-ability is extended to the contents and SQLClue annotation by Full-Text indexing.</p>
<p>The SQLRunbook is highly flexible in how information and knowledge can be stored. A book's worth raw text can be stored with each 
topic and category. The files that can be stored are limited in size only by the physical resources available. To benefit from SQL 
Server&#39;s Full Text search engine, many document types can be loaded into SQL Servers for full text indexing. The SQLClue Runbook 
can be configured to automatically maintain the database stored copy of a file as the file changes.</p>
<p>The more thoughtful, complete, and thorough this library of information and body of knowledge the less likely that anyone will be 
called at 3AM or that an obscure system will become a black box and eventually fall into disuse because the knowledge about maintaining 
the system was lost when an individual left the organization. For these reasons - along with well established documentation best 
practices - all documentation should be as complete as is practical and cover all aspects from database diagrams and development best 
practices to delete/archive strategies and the life of a backup tape. The Runbook is a fundamental tool of business continuity at the 
database layer.</p>

<h5>SQLClue Runbook Topics</h5>
<p>
    A SQLClue Runbook Topic is&nbsp;
    Each topic can have up to 2GB of text and can be associated with an unlimited 
    number of external documents. A topic row must already exist else it will be 
    created when a document is added. The console maintains this dependency 
    transparently. The application never overwrites this text. All updates append to 
    the text. In fact every action attributable to a SQLClue Runbook topic results in 
    message being added to this text. In effect, a history of the topic is 
    maintained in this text. </p>
<a name="#top0" />
<a name="#top1" />
<h5>SQLClue Runbook Documents</h5>
            </a>
<p>
    A Document record specifies the path to any valid and accessible<a 
        name="#top6" /> file</a>. Document references can be via URL, a UNC path or local
            file system path. Document Types found in <b>sys.fulltext_document_types </b>
    can be indexed by the Full Text Search Engine. Only textual data will be indexed 
    but the documents are stored as binary data. The text of these known files types is indexed
            just as a VARCHAR(MAX) column. Subsequent queries can then use the using the CONTAINS
            and FREETEXT predicates as well as the CONTAINSTABLE and FREETEXTTABLE functions
            resulting in very powerful query capabilities. The user is in full 
    control of when a binary image is loaded for full text indexing. </p>
                <p>The document types in <b><a name="#top2" />sys.fulltext_document_types</a></b> 
                as determined by the file extension for SQL Server 2005

<h5>SQLClue Runbook Categories</h5>
<p>Each Runbook topic can has only one textual attribute but can have as many documents associated to it as is appropriate.</p>
<p>The SQLClue Runbook documents the administration and operation of the SQL Servers in an environment. The intended uses of the 
   SQLClue Runbook include:</p>
<ul>           
<li>Enabling a central source of information for Network Operations, Production Operations, Development and Database Administration 
    staff.</li>
<li>Preserving the purposes, goals, implementation details, use and interesting results from the projects, problem solving, and 
    routine activities of all professionals that support an organizations SQL Server infrastructure.</li>
<li>Assuring business continuity in the event that a person of primary knowledge is not available when technical knowledge and 
    information is required.</li>
<li>Providing tangible metrics of individual contributions toward the success of the organization's SQL Server Database Applications. 
    Often IT leaders lack the specialized technical expertise to properly evaluate individual performance of highly skilled professionals.</li>
</ul>
<p>System Documentation must always be as complete as is practical. Often include all software lifecycle aspects from design data 
   decisions to development best practices to routine production activities to warehouse and delete/archive strategies. All personal 
   knowledge, plans, schedules, research, testing, and professional opinion are valid and important types of input to realize maximum 
   value from the SQLClue Runbook. All information relevant to the daily administration and operations of the SQL Servers in each environment 
   must be included. By reviewing the entries, any reasonably qualified individual is able to learn about the architecture, processes, 
   and available tools for the location.</p>
<p>The SQLClue strategy to runbook building is to capture topical information about events and activities as they happen. While it 
   may well be as easy to capture such knowledge anecdotally or ad hoc, the result is less complete and less likely to be limited to 
   a single topic. The structure of the SQLClue Runbook encourages the dedication of a few planned minutes of time each day to add and 
   update text and documents for all Topics that received attention during the day. As Topics are entered or edited, they are associated 
   with appropriate categories of database activity. A default collection of said categories is included with the SQLClue Runbook, however 
   the list can be modified as is appropriate for the organization. Dedication to this strategy will grow and evolve the Runbook’s body of 
   knowledge over time and produce a body of information that can be quickly and easily searched by topic, category, or content.</p>
<p>A collection of SQLClue Runbook reports are included on the SQLClue ReportViewer Tab. Report Server hosted (.rdl) Report Definition 
   Markup Language (RDML) can be created and deployed as desired. This ability to customize the report library as desired coupled with 
   the collection of reports included with the SQLClue Runbook creates a nearly unlimited capability to report on interesting data layer 
   information when and where it is needed.</p>

<h5>Recommended SQLClue Runbook structured adoption and maintenance methodology.</h5> 
<p>
The fundamental principle of the SQLClue Runbook maintenance methodology is that information and knowledge be added based on
the contributors activities for that day. The time demand for adding information is not great, however consistent daily 
attention to SQLClue Runbook maintenance is very important. The people using the system must invest an average of 1-5 minutes 
a day into adding, revising, and reviewing SQLClue Runbook Content.
</p>  

<p>
Even the shop that may not have a more formal over-arching Systems Runbook can begin to capture database administration 
and operational knowledge and information immediately. (Note that such shops may want to give consideration to the need for
an overarching run book.</p>
<p>Contributors should view SQLClue Runbook maintenance activities in many ways like the maintenance activities of maintaining 
a blog. Much of the data will be text. Each entry, 
or Topic can also include references to files, images, videos, and even printed materials. Also like a blog, information is 
entered in chronological context.</p> 
<p>Unlike a Blog, the SQLClue Runbook is shared by designated staff. Also the preference for the SQLClue Runbook is to place more 
important and larger topics into documents that support track changes (e.g. Microsoft Office Word and Excel) as the body of 
information grows beyond a few hundred word about a topic, they receive a date/user stamp yet become part of the original Topic 
text. The Topic and the Topic Owner do not change, but the content of topic evolves as necessary over time.</p>
<p>Unlike a wiki or blog, the SQLClue Runbook is intended to have Topics created by all authors visible at all times and to support 
editable and versioned shared documentation. While bloggers enjoy great flexibility in composition and content, SQLClue Runbook 
contributors must adhere very closely to the Topic and each Topic must be relevant to SQL Server Administration and Operations.</p>
<p>Each Runbook Topic can have only one textual annotation attribute but can have as many documents associated to it as is appropriate. 
Use the text column of the table when the topic is new. As the topic sees change activity, the text column will be appended with 
informational history about each topic change. Topics that have a changing definition or that are larger are better used if a document 
is created. Moving the good documentation to a document leaves the Topic's text column to track the history of the topic.</p>
<p>Documents created with Microsoft Office can be created with change tracking enabled. This allows the history of changes to the 
document to be stored in the document. The document can be viewed as a normal document showing only the most recent version, or as a 
history of changes by author.</p>
<p>Shops that already have a runbook like repository in place can use the SQLClue Runbook as a queue to capture necessary information 
that can then be integrated into the legacy documentation collection.</p>

<h5>Security</h5>
<p>The SQLClue Runbook uses a role based hierarchy to secure all data. The hierarchy consists of Users, Contributor, Service, Admin.
   Users (RunbookUserRole members) can query, read, peer review all Topics and Documents. Contributors can also add and edit Topics 
   and Documents. The Service Account (RunbookServiceRole members) can read underlying documents from the file system. The Runbook 
   Administrators (RunbookAdminRole members) may or may not have the file reading access of the Service. Administrators can do all 
   operations that the Contributor is authorized to conduct. The Administrator is responsible for managing Topic and Document ownership.</p>
<p>Documents can have assigned owners. The "Enforce Ownership" menu option settings determines if only the owner can change a file. Members 
   of the RunbookServiceRole can resync the database copy of all files with the file system copy provided the file location owner has 
   extended read access to the service account. Members of RunbookAdminRole can resync files, reassign ownership and also modify the 
   document provided the file location owner has extended read write access to the file location to the members of the role. File system 
   permissions are managed by the owner of the file system location. This is beyond the realm of what the SQLClue Runbook can automatically 
   configure.</p>
