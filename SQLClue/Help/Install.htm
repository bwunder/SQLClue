    collaboration within a single SQLClue administrative unit yet limits the SQLClue 
    server requirements to a single server for the team or data center. Authorized remote SQLClue Data Center 
Runbook contributors are restricted from making any SQLClue configuration changes. 
    <a href= "CommandLine.htm"><b>Command Line</b></a> compares are also available at the workstation station level. And the

<p>At any time after SQLClue Workstation is installed, the application can be promoted to 
    the Server level by installing any
of the data stores available from the Tools menu. At the Server level the <a href= "Repository.htm">SQLClue Configuration Archive</a> 
    is always enabled and a SQL Configuration Repository data store is created on a 
    user specified local SQL Server instance. The Automation Controller uses this 
    database to store schedules. THREE additional components can be installed, enabled and configured as desired:</p>

<p>The <a href="Reports.htm"><b>Reports</b></a> components are automatically extended to include powerful administrative views 
    as additional 
component data stores and the Automation controller are enabled.</p>
<p>A role based database security model allows SQLClue security to be extended into the organization by adding 
    selected database users and roles to the provided SQLClue roles. There is a role 
hierarchy for each component data store. SQL Authentication is supported for scenarios where the Windows

<h5>SQL Servers supported</h5>

<p>SQLClue can target SQL Server 2000/2005/2008/2012 Instances.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;databases set for 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0 compatibility modes are not supported</p> 

            <p>When installing SQL Clue Server components,&nbsp; the option of placing the repositories in one database or each 
                components schema in it's own - or at least different - database is at the 
                discretion of the installer. In general, if security rights between those that will access the SQL Configuration Archive and those that will access 
the Data Center Runbook are the same, placing both repositories in one physical database may be preferred. 
                The Encryption Hierarchy can be placed with any other component schema, however 
                SNAPSHOT isolation is not recommended for the FileTable based restore solution. 
                There are other scenarios where placing each data store in its own database is of higher utility. For example, if SQL 
Configuration Archive Repository will be routinely copied to an alternate location accessible by the development staff each night, 
                consider placing the data stores in separate database to 
avoid the added payload of the Data Center Runbook in those nightly copys and to avoid exposing 
                sensitive operational information outside of the data center. Organizational security considerations will usually be the 
determining factor in deciding to use one database for the SQL Configuration Archive and another for the Data Center Runbook or to place 
both in a single database. SQLCLue works the same whether one database is configured for each repository or a single database is used to 
hold both repositories. All databases must be located on the same instance when used in 
                read/write mode. For read only use any data store can be moved to another 
                server.</p>
<p></p>

    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

<h5>Server Prerequisites</h5>
            <p><b>
<a id="top23" />
                Host SQL Server Configuration</a></b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>In addition to the Workstation prerequisites, one of the following editions of SQL Server installed locally to host the SQLClue Server. 
        <ul>
            <li>SQL Server 2008 Express Edition with Advanced Services*</li> 
            <li>SQL Server 2008 Workgroup Edition</li> 
            <li>SQL Server 2008 Standard Edition</li> 
            <li>SQL Server 2008 Enterprise Edition</li>
            <li>SQL Server 2008 Developer Edition (evaluation only)</li> 
        </ul>
    </li>        
    <li>Service Pack 1 is the minimum recommended version for all installations</li>
        <li>The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator Service (MS DTC) must be 
            properly configured and active on the SQLClue host 
        and all SQL Servers that will be targeted for Event Notification based monitoring.</li>
    </ul>

            <h5>Full-Text Search</h5>
<p>Full-Text must be installed and enabled on the SQLClue Host. The application install scripts will make all necessary 
configuration changes for full text search support.</p>

<h5>Service Broker</h5>
<p>SQLClue uses of SQL Server Service Broker reliable messaging technology. Service Broker provides a robust asynchronous server side 
   operating environment.</p> 
<p>The SQL Configuration Archive Repository allows the option to use Audit and Trace Event Notifications to detect changes on all SQL Server 
   2005/2008 target SQL Instances. This option provides complete metadata change audit history and improved archive performance. By default these 
   notifications use a Service Broker Queue in the msdb database of each "Notification Enabled" target SQL Instance. The SQLClue 
   Automation Controller service start-up account (described below) and members of the SQLClueAdminRole must have permission to 
   process events from these queues. Note that the Event Notification database at each target can be any database. User's unfamiliar with 
   Service Broker and event notifications are strongly encouraged to leave the Notification database set to the default location (msdb) 
    as this provides the most straight forward implementation.</p>

<h5>CLR Integration</h5>
<p>SQLClue uses SQL Server Common Language Runtime (CLR) integration.</p> 

<p>The SQL Configuration Archive Repository is build around the SQLCfgNode User 
    Defined Type. The SQLCfgNode data type provides efficient
   VARBINARY storage and multiple URN like attribute dereferencing methods.</p> 

<p>When you install the SQL Configuration Repository component, SQLClue will determine the state of the SQLClue host's "clr enabled" 
   configuration setting. If not yet enabled, the component install will enable CLR Integration and issue the RECONFIGURE command. On a SQL Server 2008 host, the platform 
    required to host SQLClue, the configuration change occurs immediately when the RECONFIGURE statement is complete. No restart is needed.</p>

<h5>Encryption Hierarchy</h5>
<p>To support the Code Access Security (CAS) requirements for SQLClue, the Database Master Key must exist or will be created by SQLClue
   for all databases used by SQLClue data stores. This includes the master database, as well as the database(s) containing the SQLClue 
   Configuration Archive and the Data Center Runbook.</p> 
<p>SQLClue&#39;s components depend upon the encryption hierarchy to properly deploy and secure CLR Integration components 
   and to securely encrypt stored password when SQL Authentication is used.</p>
<p>In order to assure forward recovery of all SQLClue data stores in most failure scenarios, it is critical that the Service Master 
   Key and all Database Master Keys are backed up to export files, securely stored following the guidelines in SQL Server Books OnLine, 
   and that forward recovery is tested sufficiently to assure the usability of the key backups when they might be needed.</p>
<p>Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) can be used to help prevent unauthorized use of SQLClue data and is fully supported. When 
   TDE is used, a complete backup of the TDE encryption hierarchy is equally important. See SQL Server 2008 Books Online for complete 
   TDE backup requirements.</p>

<h5>Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator</h5>
<p>Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator Service (MS DTC) may not be "completely configured" in some Windows desktop enviroments, 
   especially Windows Vista. See the SQL Express install readme notes for details on Enabling MS DTC on a SQL Express host system. The 
   state of the MSDTC may vary depending upon the operating system and the SQL Server Edition of the host system. To configure MSDTC use 
   the Component Services Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in. Correctly configuring DTC is before installing SQL Server is preferred 
   over configuring on the fly, but be sure to watch the System Event Log for DTC related errors. </p> 

<p>Accessing Component Services varies by operating system. Usually one of the following 
   methods can be used:</p> 
<ul>
<li>run... dcomcnfg</li>
<li>run... %SystemRoot%\System32\comexp.msc</li>
<li>Open "Component Services" from the Administrative Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog entry from the Microsoft MS DTC program group explains the likely settings required, 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bill/archive/2006/12/12/using-msdtc-between-vista-clients-and-windows-2000-servers.aspx">
http://blogs.msdn.com/bill/archive/2006/12/12/using-msdtc-between-vista-clients-and-windows-2000-servers.aspx</a>. In the
event the blog is unavailable, the following step-by-step procedure is directly quoted from the entry:
<pre>
a.      Run dcomcnfg command (don’t tell me you couldn’t find the run commandJ)
b.      Expand the “Component Services” node, then the “My Computer” node, then the “Distributed Transaction Coordinator” node
c.      Right-Click on the “Local DTC” node and select “Properties”
d.      On the “Local DTC Properties”, select the “Security” tab
e.      Select Network DTC Access, Allow Inbound, Allow Outbound, No Authentication Required, and Enable XA Transactions
</pre>  
</p>

<h5>Hierarchical Security Roles</h5>
<p>Neither SQLClue or the install process interact with any SQL Servers during the initial install. This isolates the person installing 
   the software from the database. This is an important for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>SQLClue requires highly privileged access to all target SQL Instances.</li>
<li>The Repository stores passwords as encrypted data for highly privileged SQL Logins.</li>
</ol>
<p>The person installing applications such as SQL Server or SQLClue must be a local administrator on the host machine. However, because of 
   this isolation between the access required to install the applications and the access required to work within SQL Server, SQLClue is 
   adaptable to the security model in use by the organization. For example, the local System Adminstrator that installs SQLClue need not 
   be granted access to the SQLClue host SQL Server.</p>

<p>The SQLClue administrator may need to be a member of the sysadmin fixed server role on the local SQL Server host. 
   The level of privileged must allow the administrator to create and provision the SQLClue data stores.</p>

<h5>Two Service Principals required</h5>
<p>It is important to give careful consideration to both the host SQL Server Service start-up account and the SQLClue Automation Controller 
   start-up account.</p>

<h5>SQLClue Host SQL Server Service Start-up Account</h5>
<p>Best practice when creating the host SQL Server service account is to follow the guidelines from the SQL Server
2008 Books Online topic: "Setting up Windows Service Accounts". If SQL Server 2008 Books Online is not available
refer to the online version of the documentation on Microsoft's MSDN or TechNet web sites.</p>
<p>An unprivileged domain account is strongly recommended.</p>
<ul>Be particularly aware of the following guidelines taken directly from SQL Server 2008 Books OnLine:
<li>
If the service must interact with network services, access domain resources like file shares, or if it uses 
linked server connections to other computers running SQL Server, you might use a minimally privileged domain 
server account. Many server-to-server activities can be performed only with a domain user account.
</li>
<li>
If the computer is not part of a domain, a local user account without Windows administrator permissions is 
recommended.
</li>
<li>
Be aware that the "Local Service" account is not supported for the SQL Server or SQL Server Agent services.
</li>
<li>
Network Service is a shareable account, and is appropriate for use as a SQL Server service account only if you can 
ensure that no other services that use the account are installed on the computer.
</li>
<li>
Use caution when you assign the "Local System" account permissions to SQL Server service accounts. Local System is a very 
high-privileged account.
</li>
</ul>
<h5>The SQLClue Automation Controller Service Start-up Account</h5>
<p>Best practice when creating the SQLClue Automation Controller service account is to follow the guidelines from the SQL Server
2008 Books Online topic: "Setting up Windows Service Accounts". If SQL Server 2008 Books Online is not available
refer to the online version of the documentation on Microsoft's MSDN or TechNet web sites.</p>
    Because of the file access requirements and the administrative SQL Server access 
    on all targets using the [Local System], [Local Service] or [Network Service] 
    service account options are not recommended.</p>
        <p>It is a business continuity best practice to extend all file system rights 
            granted to the SQLClue Automation Controller service account to the SQLClue Administrator.</p>
        <p>A unprivileged domain user account other than the account used for the host SQL Server is strongly recommended. The same 
account may be used for the SQLClue Automation Controller Service and the host SQL Server, though improved security is possible 
if a different account is used by each. The SQLClue Automation Controller Service requires administrative access 
            to all targeted SQL Servers and requires the specific file system privileges 
            listed below. </p>
<p>Interactive Data Center Runbook file system I/O and database access rely upon the privileges 
    of the logged in used running the SQLClue Workstation or Console session. All SQLClue 
    automation file system I/O and database access must also be extended to the 
    SQLClue Automation Controller Service service account. This requires that the installer, SQLClue administrator or 
    Runbook Contributor assure that any necessary file system permissions are 
    properly configured. SQLClue will transparently set the necessary database 
    security on the SQLClue host and on each targeted SQL Instance.
    However, 
    because network security topologies are highly variable and often 
    proprietary, file system security must ultimately be configured and managed by the 
    user as appropriate to organizational security practices. SQL Clue provides prompts when security must be considered. It is up to 
    the user to assure that any changes are properly configured</p>
        <p>For the Data Center Runbook the SQLClue Automation Controller service account must have read access to all folders that will be 
monitored by the Data Center Runbook File Watcher. The File Watcher automatically keeps the Full Text search indexing in 
sync with changes to the underlying documents. When new document references are added to the data store, the user 
adding the document is prompted to assure that the service account has the necessary access 
            to the new document.</p>
                          
<p>SQLClue target server SMO access is always done using the privilege level of the logged in user account. 
    Consequently, all SQLClue administrators and the Automation Controller Service 
service account must have the rights and permissions necessary to script metadata 
    and extract configuration from all targeted SQL Instances. Only a member of the
    <i>sysadmin</i> Fixed Server Role will have the necessary rights 
    to access this metadata.</p>

<p>No passwords are necessary to install the application. The only requirement is that the logged in
user during the install be a local administrator when SQL Server is installed/uninstalled and when SQLClue is installed/uninstalled. 
During installation, the application will never require a database connection.</p>

<p> After installation the SQL Configuration Archive and the Data Center Runbook Repositories can be created using the SQLClue 
User Interface. It is intended that any SQLClue maintenance is also completed using the Console. 
All scheduled actions that require external access run under the authority of the SQLClue Automation Controller service account server principal. 
Service Broker automation on the SQLClue host relies upon the authority of the SQL Server Service Account Server Principal of the host SQL Server.</p>

<p>The avalable SQL Servers shown in all connection dialogs is the union of the "Browsable Servers" 
that SMO is able to enumerate and the servers currently configured within SQLClue. The configured instances cannot be eliminated from the list. 
However, the "Browsable Servers" discovered on the network by the enum can be managed 
    to some extent. Regardless of how many SQL Servers that exist on the 
network, if the network is large and the load time for the SQLClue console is slow turn the server enumeration down to either Local or None 
for improved startup performance. Chances are quite high that the SMO enumeration 
    will not find all SQL Servers on a large network. If the name os the SQL Server 
    is known it can always be types into the connection dialog.</p>

<h5>Changing the Server Discovery Scope setting</h5>

<!--BEGIN ADD CONSIDERATIONS areas the user must think carefully about-->

<h5>Use and licensing Scenarios:</h5>
<ul>

<li><b>Local License</b><ul>

    <li><b>Developer</b> - in this scenario a SQL Server Instance is installed at the developer's workstation. As the developer works, 
database changes are instantly captured and regularly loaded to the local SQLClue. This protects the developer from losing 
work and allow easy revert to any previos &quot;compile&quot; of a scripted database object during 
        development. The developer can also modify any configuration on the local instance or even the local 
SQLClue configuration yet always be able to identify what has been changed. In addition the developer can quickly verify that 
the unit test environment is equivalent to a production or other pre-production integrative environment. There is no need for 
the developer to directly access the external environment if a DBA or Team SQLClue is also configured to monitor that live or 
integrative environment. The developer is optionally able to compare local SQLClue or 
        local SQL Instance configuration to that stored in a reference SQLClue Repository 
        available on the network.</li>

<li><b>Stand Alone</b>  - in this scenario a SQLClue Local license is used to monitor changes on an integrative or shared SQL Server 
instance. SQLClue is installed locally on the server to be monitored and the repository database is installed locally. This can be 
an effective alternative for a development environment where each developer does not have an isolated unit test SQL Server or when
a non-centralized configuration is preferred.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Environment License</b>
<ul>

<li><b>DBA</b> - in this scenario a SQL Server Instance is installed on a DBA's workstation or server in a small environment consisting of
between 2 or more SQL Instances. The configuration for all instances is monitored for changes and archived to the central instance.</li>

<li><b>Team</b> - similar to DBA scenarion but better for Integrative Test, QA, and other environments that require more than one use
to access the data store for comparisons at the central SQLClue host. This server might be configured as a replication publisher of  
SQLClue data that is copied to a location accessible to developers without having to allow direct developer access to the monitored 
environment. It may be configured with a Report Server Instance or the subscriber might supply the Report Server with data.</li>

<li><b>Environment</b> - in this scenario. This level of use is most likely to require stand-alone server class hardware.Installation 
of a repository instance in each environment (for example Production, QA, Integrative Test or Unit Test) is recommended. 
Hosting other central monitoring and administration databases along with the SQLClue host may be considered in this configuration option. 
    SQLClue is ideally suited for use on a SQL Server Central Management Server 
    (CMS)</li>  
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Please drop me an email with your scenario and I will gladly provide my input about configurations you may wish to consider.</p>

<h5>SQLClue Component Databases</h5>
<p>There are two components that require data stores on the host SQL instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>SQL Configuration Archive Repository</li>
<li>Data Center Runbook Repository</li>
</ol>
<p>These can be configured within a single database or can be can be placed in a separate database. The Setup dialogs for 
each component will default to a a database named <b>SQLClue</b>. To use a different database name, change the name 
in the setup connection dialog. If the database exists the installation will create the component schema the 
    existing database. Otherwise, the installation will create the database and then install component schema.</p>  
<h5>Database Storage Requirements</h5>
            <p>By default SQLClue creates each database with a 100MB size on a single default 
                device as determined by the host SQL Instance configuration. This is a 
                reasonable size for test and evaluation Repositories and is also adequate for initial trial of the 
                Data Center Runbook databases. The Runbook component storage 
                requirements will vary greatly between organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a id="top22" />
    <b>SQL Configuration Repository</b> - a safe rule of thumb would be 1MB of database storage required for each 
    50 database objects to be 
archived.
</li>
    <li><b>Data Center Runbook</b> - The Data Center Runbook requires file system storage and database storage. While the number of topic entries will likely never 
exceed a few hundred each topic may require in excess of 1MB of storage. The actual storage per topic will vary 
        according to the size and tyoe of the documents added to the Runbook Library. The recommendation is 
to initially allocate 100MB of database storage and 100MB of File System storage for the Data Center Runbook. As with all database applications, 
usage should be monitored.
</li>  
</ul>
<p>Always follow organizational Best Practices to monitor physical storage 
    utilization and adapt as necessary. There are a number of Microsoft and third 
    party tools available to aid in tracking database growth and calculating storage 
    requirements. The method used to track the growth and establish storage 
    requirements of the SQLClue target instances 
    should also be used for the SQLClue host. A Management Data Warehouse configured 
    on the SQLClue host collecting data from the host and all targets is an optimal 
    usage scenario.</p>

<p>To control the CREATE DATABASE of any SQLClue data store, create the database or 
    databases that will be used before installing the data stores in SQLClue. That is, before running the install for that SQLClue component. This gives 
 full control over size, options and location of the database created. Then, simply specify the same database 
 name in the setup dialog in SQLClue when "Install..." is selected. If the database does not exist, the server defaults 
 are used during install. If the database does exist, the script runs in the context of that existing database.</p>
 <p>The scripts are non-destructive. That is a little different than idempotent. Non-destructive means data will never be lost by running the 
 script. Idempotent means running the script will always produce the same resulting state in the database. 
     The Scripts recreate all DML objects (procedures, functions, triggers, etc.) but 
     do not replace existing tables. If necessary it is acceptable to re-apply the 
     installation script for any component using the SQL Server Management Studio 
     (SSMS) query tool or SQLCMD. Keep in mind that to drop and create objects 
     results in two versions in SQLClue. To completely remove and recreate the data store it is necessary 
     to use the &quot;Uninstall&quot; tools menu option.&nbsp; </p>
<table width="90%" style="background-color: HighlightText; color:Highlight"><tr><td style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold" class="style1">&nbsp;!&nbsp;</td>
    <td style="background-color: Highlight; color:HighlightText" class="style1">
            <p>Dropping a database before running an &quot;Uninstall&quot; will corrupt the data store settings for all affected components. 
            To recover from such corruption:</p> 
               <ol>
               <li>Stop the SQLClue Automation Controller Service.</li>
               <li>Backup all remaining SQLClue component databases.</li>
               <li>Remove all references to the data store(s) that were held in the dropped database from the user.config that 
                   reference the data store.</li>
               <li>Once the SQLClue Console is able to load, uninstall and reinstall the SQLClue Automation Controller Service.</li>
               </ol> 
               <p>Do not hesitate to contact Bill if the installation becomes corrupted. In all know situations it is possible to
                  recover from corruption provided proper action is taken.</p>

 <p>Space and growth of the Data Center Runbook will be a function of actual usage. If you plan to load 
     many documents into SQL 
 Runbook, the storage requirements are greater than if you intend to primarily add knowledge and information as a few lines 
 of text input directly into the Data Center Runbook database. Documents combined with Full Text Search, Track Changes, and Notifications, render the 
 Runbook more accessible to users but will require more storage. Flexible storage options allow the documents to be easily served up as intranet links from a result set that 
 matches the user query.</p>

<h5>Setting SQLClue to "run as administrator"</h5>
<p>Using SQLClue on systems with User Access Control (UAC) may require that SQLClue is always explicitly

            <p style="font-weight:bold">SQLClue Component Installation and Maintenance</p>
            <p>The SQLClue UI Tool&#39;s menu provides access to all configuration options available 
                for each component.When a data store is required, a menu option to &quot;Install&quot; is available. When 
                a data store has already been installed, options to modify the database 
                connection details such as on the wire encryption or connection timeout and 
                &quot;Uninstall&quot; the component are available. Additionally, if the component has 
                other configurable settings, options to manage the settings are available for 
                any installed component. </p>

SQLClue Event Notifications are enable and disabled on a per target SQL Instance basis. This is done using 
scripts that changes the configuration on the Target SQL Instance.
Reviewing these scripts will help in understanding the small size and low risk of the change. Nonetheless
it is strongly recommended that the scripts are reviewed prior to enabling event Notification on any server. 
Likewise, and as ought to be true for any software being introduce into an environment, proper testing before
placing SQLClue in a live environment is prudent. Follow these links to review the 
<a href="../SQLScripts/instSQLClueDDLEventNotifications.sql">script to enable change Event Notifications</a> and the 
<a href="../SQLScripts/uninstSQLClueDDLEventNotifications.sql">script to disable change Event Notifications</a>  
script to enable DDL and configuration change event notification that will run on any target SQL Server instance 
when SQLClue event notifications are enabled on that SQL Instance.
You may also at anytime disable event notifications on a server. This script will run to remove the 
configuration changes on a target server.
