    <h4>Contributing to the SQLClue Data Center Runbook</h4>

    <p>This page demonstrates how to add and maintain knowledge resources and information in the SQLClue 
        Data Center Runbook. 
    </p>
    <p>A usable first Runbook Topic: &quot;Using the SQLClue Runbook&quot; is created during the example.</p>
    <p>Files that are included in the SQLClue installation and files that can be 
        obtained from the SQLClue web site are used for this exercise. This hands-on exercize 
    demonstrates the use of the Runbook for a user with the authority to create and own topics and documents: Contributors and Admins 
    in the SQLClue security role hierarchy. In addition, upon completion of the exercize a valid 
        Data Center Runbook topic is initialized. The topic created is useful as a starting 
        entry in the Data Center Runbook for any local environment. Bear in mind that no SQLClue Runbook topic is ever complete. 
        The data center systems the Runbook supports will continuously change. The 
        Runbook must be updated as change occurs. </p>

    <h4><b>Install the Data Center Runbook</b></h4>
    <p>To begin this walkthrough install the SQLClue Administrator&#39;s Console, install 
        the SQL Configuration Archive from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu of the SQLClue 
        Administrator&#39;s Console. Next install the Data Center Runbook component also 
        found under the &quot;Tools&quot; menu.&nbsp; Navigate to the Runbook tab of the SQLClue Console.</p>

    <h4><b>Data Center Runbook User Interface Layout</b></h4>
    <p>The Runbook tab is divided into two an upper section and a lower section. The upper section contains a 
       Topic List data grid. The data grid is populated by a default query each time the 
        SQLClue Administrator&#39;s Console is launched. The default query is suitable for 
        most Data Center Runbook usage.&nbsp; The search query can also be modified as 
        desired. A Topic is opened by selecting the topic from the upper region. The lower section shows 
        all details for a Topic once selected. Alternately, a Topic may be selected from the Topic 
        Combo Box drop down list at the beginning of the lower section, even if the 
        topic is not loaded in the upper regions data grid. All topics in the Runbook 
        are available in the drop down list. </p>
    <p><b>Tip</b>: The splitter between the upper Topic list and the Topic details section 
        below can be
       repositioned to improve the user view of the displayed data as desired.</p>

    <h4><b>Create a Runbook Topic</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Select any cell column of the first blank row in the upper section's <b>Topic List</b> data grid.</li>
        <li>Enter the text &quot;Using the SQLClue Runbook&quot; in the Topic Name input dialog that opens.</li>
        <li>Select [Ok] in the Topic Name input dialog. </li>
        <li>As the dialog closes the data grid row is populated with the Name and default 
            values for other row values.</li>
        <li><b>Quick Add of a Runbook Topic Note</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Select the Notes column cell adjacent and to the right of the Topic Name column 
                cell in the Topic List data grid.</li>
            <li>Enter the following text in the &quot;Add a Note&quot; (lower) field of the Notes input dialog 
                that opens when the Notes cell is selected.
            <pre>Topic created while working through the How-to &quot;Contribute to the Runbook&quot; help document.</pre></li>
            <li>Select [Ok] in the Notes input dialog.</li>
                <li>Preview the note just added by hovering the mouse over the Notes cell in the Topic List data grid. The preview feature is handy but is limited to showing only the first few hundred characters of the Notes column. 
                    To view the complete note the Notes cell must be selected to relaunch the notes 
                    dialog.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Editing Notes for a Selected Runbook Topic</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the Topic Name cell column containing the text &quot;Using the SQLClue Runbook&quot; from the Topic List 
                    data grid.</li>
                <li>The Topic is loaded into the lower section for editing and the Name will appear 
                    in the Topic Name input box.</li>
                <li>Select the Notes Button that is adjacent and to the right of the Topic Name 
                    input box in the lower panel.</li>
                <li>The same Notes dialog is opened as when accessing the Topic&#39;s Notes in the Topic 
                    List of the 
                upper panel. </li>
                <li>The Note entered above now appears in the upper text panel of the Notes dialog. 
                    The lower region is reserved for new notes entries.</li>
                <li>Enter the following text on separate lines as shown in the &quot;Add a Note&quot; 
                    (lower) field of the Notes dialog.

                </li>
                <li>Move the splitter between the previous notes (top) panel and the new note (bottom) to reveal all entered text. 
                Alternately resize the Notes dialog or zoom from the context menu to customize the view of either notes panel. 
                Scroll bars are also available if the text in either field overflows the visible area.</li>
                <li>It is possible to open the previously entered notes for edit. This option is provided for administrator 
                convenience only so that direct ad hoc query updates are never required. Editing previous notes is not recommended because the audit trail is bypassed when this method is used. Best 
                practice is to always add notes to the bottom panel of the Notes dialog.</li>
                <li>Select [Ok] in the Notes dialog.</li>
                <li>Hover over the Notes cell of the Topic List (upper panel) to verify the information just added.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <b>Tip</b>: The upper panel of the notes dialog is normally in read-only mode. To edited text in this panel select the &quot;edit 
           previous notes&quot; link in the upper right corner of the dialog. Editing previous notes should be used only rarely if at all.
           The historical audit trail is broken when changes are made to the previous notes. The feature is provided only as an alternative 
           to ad-hoc updates to the notes by directly updating the database.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Selecting a Category for a Runbook Topic</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Select &quot;Contact&quot; In the Category List at the bottom left of the lower section.</li>
                <li>There is <i><b>no need</b> to hold the [CTRL] key </i>when selecting multiple Categories for a 
                    Topic. However, it is OK to do so since the [CTRL] key has no effect on the 
                    category selection process. When categories are selected or de-selected the background color of the Category panel changes to indicate that that there 
                    is data that must be saved. </li>
                <li>Select [Save] in the lower panel of the Dialog.</li>
                <li>Each change does not need to be saved individually. Documents can be added. 
                    Categories selected or de-selected and the Topic name can be modified. The 
                    changes can all be committed to the database as a single save operation at any 
                    time the Save button is selected - and also any time a Note is added the topic 
                    will be save.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <b>Tip</b>: The Category list can be displayed as a scrolling one column list or as multi-column list that can be 
               displayed in its entirety on the screen. Under &quot;SQLClue Runbook&quot; in the &quot;Tools&quot; menu, select the &quot;Multicolumn
               Category List&quot; option to toggle the display between the two views at any time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Select the Notes button again. Notice that the system has added a note to indicate that the Contact Category was 
            associated with the Topic. 
            In general it is handy to add the Category at the same time as the content is 
            added that belongs to the category because the notes can later be reviewed to 
            see the relationship, however this is not required. SQLClue Runbook Categories 
            are primarily a search aid and the search results will not be affected whether 
            or not the category and content are entered at the same time. The practice 
            merely helps to understand the sequence and evolution of the Topic.</li>
        <li>Select &quot;Best Practice&quot; in the Category List the selection since the note just 
            entered is a &quot;Best Practice&quot;. </li>
        <li>Enter the following text. 
            <pre>1. Always update the topic with all changes from the application defaults. 
2. Include a comment to explain why the change was made and any specialized information about 
   the reasons for the change and how to properly effect the change. 
3. Keep notes brief. 
4. Place lengthy comments and diagrams in a document and add the document rather than adding a note. 
5. Assign categories immediately after each note as an aid to users that may later search or browse the topic.             
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Select [Ok] in the Notes input dialog. The Note and the Category selection are 
            added to the Topic.</li>
        <li>Select the &quot;Security&quot; Category in preparation for adding the next note.</li>
        <li>Open the Notes input dialog again and enter the following, replacing 'enter service account name' with 
            the name of the SQLClue Automation Controller service account used when the 
            service was configured.&nbsp;
            <pre>Authorize domain users and groups to access the Runbook by adding them to the SQLRunbookUserRole 
or SQLRunbookContributorRole database roles. The SQLClue Automation Controller Service account must 
have read access to file system folder before document file(s) can be managed by the SQLClue Runbook 
the service account name is 'enter service account name'.</pre>
        </li>
        <li>If the SQLClue Automation Controller service is not yet been installed, add a reminder note. Select &quot;MemoToSelf&quot; in the Category List 
            and enter the note: &nbsp;
            <pre>Service not installed at this time. Add the service account to the Topic when the service is installed. 
Other users will need to know this service account name when they add documents to the SQLClue Runbook. 
There is no need for each Runbook Contributor to have to search out and interrupt the person that knows 
this bit of information when it is needed. Saving such information in these notes provides easy 
visibility of necessary information to the appropriate people.</pre>
    <p>
        <b>Tip</b>: The &quot;MemoToSelf&quot; Category is a time saver used to identify 
        work that needs to be done and early stage work in progress. Including memos as 
        they come to mind is a good way to call out work that needs to be done. 
        Categorizing the topic as one with such outstanding work requirements helps to 
        find the work items in the future. It also helps others to identify 
        documentation areas that need attention. In most cases the reason documentation 
        is incomplete or not available is because the topic described by the 
        documentation needs attention. Once the work captured as a memo is completed or 
        assigned to a more precise category, the &quot;MemoToSelf&quot; category can be removed 
        from the topic. &quot;MemoToSelf&quot; should only be a temporarily assigned category.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Add this note:             
        <pre>Add the appropriate domain users and groups to the 
SQLRunbookUserRole and SQLRunbook ContributorRole database roles.</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Return later to the topic and record any additional determination of how role membership has been determined and 
            perhaps to list the members added to each role. Most shops will have already existing methods to capture the role
            membership enumeration changes. The SQLClue Configuration Archive is an 
            excellent way to capture such changes. Including redundant information in the Runbook 
            is not recommended. Simply state where the information can be found. Searches 
            using the &quot;MemoToSelf&quot; category will quickly find the unfinished work. Removing the &quot;MemoToSelf&quot; 
            category when outstanding tasks are completed will then remove the Topic from 
            subsequent searches based on criteria that include the &quot;MemoToSelf&quot; category. 
    <p><b>Tip</b>:: While a Note is not necessary when a document is added, when a series of 
            documents will be added use of a note helps to make it clear which documents are 
            being added at a particular time.</p>
            </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Select &quot;FullText Search&quot; in the Category.</li>
        <li>In the Notes Dialog enter:
            <pre>The application's pertinent HTML help files and other documents included with the base install are loaded for Full-Text indexing. </pre>
        </li>
        <li><b>Adding a Document to a Runbook Topic</b>
            <ol>
                <li>In the Documents data grid just below the lower sections Topic Name input, select any cell 
                of the first blank row.</li>
                <li>This will open the File Open dialog. Navigate to the Help subfolder of the SQLClue Program installation folder 
                in the dialog.&nbsp;
                    <p>
                        The &quot;Resources&quot; shortcut in the SQLClue Program Start Menu group also opens the 
                program folder. Use this shortcut to help determine the path if necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Tip</b>: In some scenarios it may be necessary to obtain read access rights to the Program 
                    Group and the subfolders before continuing. If this step is necessary at this 
                    time, also obtain the same rights for the SQLClue Automation Controller Service 
                    Account. This will save time and eliminate an interruption for you and possibly 
                    another person later.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Select the &quot;Runbook.htm&quot; file.</li>
                <li>Select the [OK] in the Open File dialog.</li>
                <li>The &quot;File System Rights Changes Required&quot; dialog opens to advise you of the access SQLClue expects for the file.</li>
                <li>Set the necessary file permissions or copy the requirements to the clipboard and notify the appropriate person of
                the necessary permission changes.
                    <p>
                        An alternative would be to remove the check from the &quot;Watch File for Changes&quot; 
                    cell column check box. The advantages of assigning the permissions include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>the &quot;SQLClue Automation Controller&quot; will be able to keep the file and the Full-Text 
                   index synchronized if the service account has read access to the file</li>
                        <li>Business continuity efforts are improved if the SQLClue Administrator is able to reassign the file
                   to a different user should the need arise.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Select a cell of the blank row to recall the Open File Dialog.</li>
        <li>Select the &quot;Install.htm&quot; file.</li>
        <li>Select the [OK] in the Open File dialog.</li>
        <li>If security was set at the file level above, repeat the assignment for this file. Share and Directory rights will
            be the same as for the Runbook.htm so no additional changes are needed at those levels.</li>
        <li>Select a cell of the blank row to recall the Open File Dialog.</li>
        <li>Select the &quot;Services.htm&quot; file.</li>
        <li>Select the [OK] in the Open File dialog.</li>
        <li>If security was set at the file level above, repeat the assignment for this file. Share and Directory rights will
            be the same as for the Runbook.htm so no additional changes are needed at those levels.</li>
        <li>Locate and download the following documents from the Internet. Both can be found from the SQLClue web site (http://www.bwunder.com) 
            Save the documents to any location on the local network and repeat the steps used to load the 
            Install.htm and Services.htm documents to load the downloaded documents into the 
            Data Center Runbook. The saved documents can HTML, text, or even PDF or any other format that is recognized by the 
            IFilters available in the SQLClue host SQL Server. <b>Hint!</b> For more details about SQL Server IFilters see the 
            second article listed.

    <p>This document demonstrates a method that can be used to quickly bring all available documentation into the SQLClue 
       Runbook very quickly.</p>
       <p> If the current owners of existing system documentation use this method to add and classify all 
       documents then access to the information is quickly established for a wider, yet still appropriate audience. Furthermore, 
       the prospects for others to be able to find the relevant information should any individual leave the organization or 
       assume new duties or be home asleep in the middle of night are greatly increased. The silly jostle to get a &quot;short 
       timer&quot; - one who will soon leave their current position - to spend the last few days of an assignment producing low quality 
       documentation is completely avoided to the benefit of all.</p>
       <p> If the permissions are established according to these recommendations, 
       the SQLClue Administrator can easily reassign the documents to any individual at any time necessary. The documents can be updated 
       when convenient and necessary yet will always be automatically maintained in the SQLClue Runbook central system information library.</p>
