<h4>Comparing SQL Configurations</h4>
    <p>This tutorial describes comparing SQL Server configuration items and collections of items.  The narrative will first 
    focus on comparing the <i>Settings</i> on two SQL Instances, then on comparing the tables collection from a database on one SQL Instance to 
    the tables collection from a database on another SQL Instance. </p>
    <p>To begin the walkthrough, open the SQLClue application and navigate to the &quot;Configuration Compare&quot; tab. 
       Review the <i>Quick Start</i> information shown in the Configuration Compare results panels. 
        Notice that the User Interface is split into two sides: <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> 
        and that each side is further split into an input panel where the compare is 
        configured and an output panel where the results of the compare are displayed.</p>
    <p>If only a single SQL Server is available, consider using two different databases on the SQL Instance. 
        This option will work as effectively for the tutorial. Comparing 
       a configuration item to itself will also work but is not very interesting since 
        there will not be any real differences.</p>
    <h4><b>Comparing the Server Settings of Two SQL Instances</b></h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>The first step in configuring each side of a compare is to select the <b>Origin</b>. The 
        <b>Origin</b> is the location SQLClue will use to
    source the metadata to be compared. There are three possible <b>Origins</b>:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><b>SQLInstance</b> - SQLClue will connect to the a target SQL Instance and document the configuration using SMO.</li>
    <li><b>Repository</b> - SQLClue will query the indicated SQLClue Repository for archived versions of configuration 
    elements previously generated using the same algorithm as the SQLInstance origin above will use during the compare.
    <p>The <b>Repository</b> <b>Origin</b> will allow the selection of a specific version when doing item-vs-item compares. The default is the
    most recent version.  When the compare is Collection-vs-Collection, the most recent version or alternately the versions associated 
    with a specified label are used.</p></li>
    <li><b>File</b> - SQLClue can be pointed to a file system folder containing script files. This allows scripts from disconnected
    SQL instances and more importantly source code "working folder" to be used in either or both 'sides' of any compare. The File 
    Origin is available only when doing item-vs-item. The Collection-vs-Collection compares and 
        the <b>SQLClue -cmd</b> comand line options are not supported for compares
    using the '<b>File</b>' Origin.  
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To begin the walkthrough, select the &quot;<b>SQLInstance</b>&quot; Origin from Origin drop down list on side &quot;<b>A</b>&quot;</p></li>
    <li>A dialog is opened to select the SQL Instance and configure the connection string.
        <ol>         
        <li><b>Connect to a Target SQL Instance</b>
            <p>Several connection options can be set, although in most scenarios all that is needed is to select or enter 
            the SQL Instance and then hit the [OK] button.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Select or enter the name of the SQL Instance to be targeted in the &quot;SQL Instance&quot; input box of the
                &quot;Connect to a Target SQL Instance&quot; dialog.</li>
            <li>Leave the database name blank. 
            <p>When no database is selected, the &quot;Configuration Compare&quot; connection uses the default database configured 
               for the login at the Target SQL Instance.</p></li>
            </ol>
         </li>   
         <li><b>Configure the Connection Authentication</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Leave the &quot;Use Trusted Connection&quot; check box checked. 
            <p>When SQL Authentication must be used un-check the checkbox and provide a valid SQL Login/Password combination.</p>
            <p>Whether Windows Authentication is used or SQL Authentication is used the user must be a member of the <i>sysadmin</i> Fixed Server Role. While some items can be compared with a less powerful 
               account, many configuration items, including the Server Settings, can be compared only when the user is a <i>sysadmin</i> 
              member.</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Configure the Connection Settings</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Leave the Connection Timeout value set to the default (60 seconds).
                <p>Only adjust the Connection Timeout when necessary. In most scenarios the the default value is 
                    more than adaquate.</p></li>
            <li>Leave the Network Library blank.
                <p>When no library is selected, the values enabled in the SQL Native Client Configuration will be used. Using the SQL 
                Native Client configured protocols has the added advantage of escalating the protocol if the Target does not accept
                a connection using the first protocol in the configured protocol list.</p></li>
            <li>Leave the &quot;Encrypt Connection&quot; check box un-checked.
            <p>To encrypt the data sent on the wire select the &quot;Encrypt Connection&quot; check box. By default, an SSL certificate
               must be installed on the host operating system of the Target SQL Instance to encrypt data on the wire.</p></li>            
            <li>Leave the &quot;Trust Server Certificate&quot; check box un-checked.
            <p>When data encryption on the wire is desired yet an SSL certificate is not available, select the &quot;Trust Server 
               Certificate&quot; check box. Trust Server Certificate is meaningful only if <i>Encrypt Connection</i> is checked.</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Select the dialog's [OK] button to connect to the SQL Instance.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>   
    <li style="font-weight: 700">The &quot;A&quot; side Treeview will be populated with a view of the Configuration Hierarchy available from the SQL Instance.</li>
    <li>Select &quot;SQLInstance&quot; from the drop down list for Origin &quot;<b>B</b>&quot;</li>
    <li>Repeat the <b>Connect to a Target SQL Instance</b> dialog steps to connect to the second SQL Instance.
    </li>    
    <li style="font-weight: 700">The &quot;B&quot; side Treeview will be populated with a view of the Configuration Hierarchy available from the SQL Instance.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;Settings&quot; node from the &quot;<b>A</b>&quot; side TreeView.</li> 
    <li>Select the &quot;Settings&quot; node from the &quot;<b>B</b>&quot; side TreeView.</li> 
    <li>Open the <b>Compare Options</b> dialog located in the &quot;Tools&quot; menu.</li>
    <li>Expand the &quot;<b>Misc</b>&quot; Category shown on the left side of the dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;<b>Display Output</b>&quot; Category revealed when &quot;<b>Misc&quot;</b> was expanded.</li>
    <li>Verify that the &quot;<b>Show Comparison Details</b>&quot; setting is checked.</li>
    <li>Select the [OK] button of the <b>Modify Compare Settings</b> dialog to close the dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the [Compare] button to initiate the compare.</li> 
    <li>The line by line results of the tabulated name-pair settings values will be shown in the adjacent results panels.</li>
        <li></li> 
    </ul>
    
    <h4><b>Comparing the Tables from Two SQL Server Databases</b></h4>
    <p>This walkthrough will presume to compare the tables from an AdventureWorks database and an AdventureWorks2008 database. 
       Any user databases can be substituted to follow along with this walk-through when two accessible SQL Instances 
       with these AdventureWorks databases are not available in the environment. The same SQLInstance can be selected for both
       side &quot;A&quot; and side &quot;B&quot;. However, the same database can be selected for both side &quot;A&quot; and side 
       &quot;B&quot; only if different SQLInstance have been targeted.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Select &quot;SQLInstance&quot; from the drop down list for Origin &quot;A&quot;</li>
    <li>A dialog is opened to select the SQL Instance and configure the connection string.
        <ol>         
        <li><b>Connect to a Target SQL Instance</b>
            <p>Several connection options can be set, although in most scenarios all that is needed is to select or enter 
            the SQL Instance and then hit the [OK] button.</p></li>
            <ol>
            <li>Select or enter the name of the SQL Instance to be targeted in the &quot;SQL Instance&quot; input box of the
                &quot;Connect to a Target SQL Instance&quot; dialog.</li>
            <li>Leave the database name blank. 
            <p>When no database is selected, the &quot;Configuration Compare&quot; connection uses the default database configured 
               for the login at the Target SQL Instance.</p></li>
            </ol>
        <li><b>Configure the Connection Authentication</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Leave the &quot;Use Trusted Connection&quot; check box checked. 
            <p>When SQL Authentication must be used un-check the checkbox and provide a valid SQL Login/Password combination.</p>
            <p>The user must be a member of the <i>sysadmin</i> Fixed Server Role. While some items can be compared with a less powerful 
               account, many configuration items, including the Server Settings, can be compared only when the user is a <i>sysadmin</i> 
              member.</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Configure the Connection Settings</b>
            <ol>
            <li>Leave the Connection Timeout value set to the default (60 seconds).
                <p>Only adjust the Connection Timeout when necessary. In most scenarios the the default value is acceptable.</p></li>
            <li>Leave the Network Library blank.
                <p>When no library is selected, the values enabled in the SQL Native Client Configuration will be used. Using the SQL 
                Native Client configured protocols has the added advantage of escalating the protocol if the Target does not accept
                a connection using the first protocol in the configured protocol list.</p></li>
            <li>Leave the &quot;Encrypt Connection&quot; check box un-checked.
            <p>To encrypt the data sent on the wire select the &quot;Encrypt Connection&quot; check box. By default, an SSL certificate
               must be installed on the host operating system of the Target SQL Instance to encrypt data on the wire.</p></li>            
            <li>Leave the &quot;Trust Server Certificate&quot; check box un-checked.
            <p>When data encryption on the wire is desired yet an SSL certificate is not available, select the &quot;Trust Server 
               Certificate&quot; check box.</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Select the dialog's [OK] button to connect to the SQL Instance.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>The &quot;A&quot; side Treeview will be populated with a view of the Configuration Hierarchy available from the SQL Instance.</li>
    <li>Select &quot;SQLInstance&quot; from the drop down list for Origin &quot;B&quot;</li>
    <li>Expand the &quot;Databases&quot; node from the &quot;A&quot; side TreeView.</li> 
    <li>Expand the AdventureWorks database node revealed from the &quot;A&quot; side TreeView.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;Tables&quot; node from the &quot;A&quot; side TreeView.</li> 
    <li>Repeat the <b>Connect to a Target SQL Instance</b> to connect to the second SQL Instance.</li>    
    <li>The &quot;B&quot; side Treeview will be populated with a view of the Configuration Hierarchy available from the SQL Instance.</li>
    <li>Expand the &quot;Databases&quot; node from the &quot;B&quot; side TreeView.</li> 
    <li>Expand the AdventureWorks database node revealed from the &quot;B&quot; side TreeView.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;Tables&quot; node from the &quot;B&quot; side TreeView.</li> 
    <li>Open the <b>Modify Compare Settings</b> dialog located in the &quot;Tools&quot; menu.</li>
    <li>Expand the &quot;Misc&quot; Category shown on the left side of the dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;Display Output&quot; Category revealed when &quot;Misc&quot; was expanded.</li>
    <li>Verify that the &quot;Show Differences Only&quot; setting is not checked.</li>
    <li>Verify that the &quot;Show Comparison Details&quot; setting is not checked.</li>
    <li>Select the [OK] button of the <b>Compare Options</b> dialog to close the dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the [Compare] button to initiate the compare.</li> 
    <li>The line by line results of the tabulated name-pair settings values will be shown in the adjacent results panels. 
        Differences will be highlighted in accordance with the key shown at the bottom 
        of the compare window.</li>
    </ul>

<p>If differences are indicated between the two table collections, the  details can be reviewed in two general ways. In the first 
   method, the same compare is repeated but the details are allowed to flow to the screen. In the second, specific objects with 
   indicated differences are compared with details enabled producing a much smaller result in a faster time.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>View details method one - collection level compare</b></li>
    <li>Open the <b>Compare Options</b> dialog located in the &quot;Tools&quot; menu.</li>
    <li>Expand the &quot;<b>Misc</b>&quot; Category shown on the left side of the dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;<b>Display Output</b>&quot; Category revealed when &quot;<b>Misc</b>&quot; was expanded.</li>
    <li>Verify that the &quot;<b>Show Differences Only</b>&quot; setting is not checked.</li>
    <li>Verify that the &quot;<b>Show Comparison Detail</b>s&quot; setting is checked.
    <p>Alternately, to see only lines with differences, Verify that the &quot;<b>Show Differences Only</b>&quot; setting is checked and 
       that the &quot;<b>Show Comparison Details</b>&quot; setting is not checked.</p></li>
    <li>Select the [OK] button of the <b>Modify Compare Settings</b> dialog to close the dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the [Compare] button to initiate the compare.</li>
